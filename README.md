## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

On this site I document all my findings and projects during my years at university.
For my personal site, checkout my [portfolio site](http://matsfockaert.tk).

### Introduction to this page

For each year, there is a dedicated page that will take you to that project's ReadMe where there is more information about the project and my implementation.
I am currently also using this for cloud storage purposes.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dutie/Uni/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
